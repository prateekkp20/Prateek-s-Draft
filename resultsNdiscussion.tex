\section{Results}
We took a system of 10,000 Na and Cl ions in a 25 \AA box for our benchmarking. Based on our analysis for various gamma values, we calculated the reciprocal space energies for a given system, and checked for the convergence of the sum.

\subsubsection*{SPME with our 2D Ewald}
Now to speed up the calculations, we calculated the structure factor using bspline interpolation and FFT. The best accuracy and optimal time of our method+SPME is determined from the combination of gamma, order and grid. smaller the gamma, higher the grid points required for the interpolation.
